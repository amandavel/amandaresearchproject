This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

For this assignment, I would like you to develop your analysis using the analysis.Rmd in your project repository to keep a lab notebook of your findings. The analysis does not have to be complete but should at least contain some figures and initial models as well as text describing what you have found so far. You should knit this lab notebook to HTML. 

You can create new code chunks for your figures and tables. Label all code chunks with sensible names. For figures I would recommend using "echo=FALSE" in the code chunk header to display the figures but not your code. For tables of regression results, I would recommend using the texreg library and the knitreg function to display your results. If you do this, be sure to include "results='asis' " in your code chunk header. 

When your assignment is ready, please be sure to push changes to GitHub and summon me with @AaronGullickson in a new issue.
